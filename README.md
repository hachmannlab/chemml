# ChemML
ChemML is a machine learning and informatics program suite for the analysis, mining, and modeling of chemical and materials data.
Please check the [ChemML website](https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml) for more information.

## Code Design:
ChemML is developed in the Python 3 programming language and makes use of a host of data analysis and ML libraries(accessible through the Anaconda distribution), as well as domain-specific libraries. 
The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

The format of library is similar to the well known libraries like Scikit-learn. 


## Latest Version:
   - to find out about the latest version and release history, click [here](https://pypi.org/project/chemml/#history)

## Installation and Dependencies:
You can download ChemML from PyPI via pip.

    pip install chemml --user -U

Here is a list of external libraries that will be installed with chemml:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - tensorflow
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - lxml
   - openpyxl
   - ipywidgets

We strongly recommend you to install ChemML in an Anaconda environment. The instructions to create the environment, install ChemMLâ€™s dependencies, and subsequently install Chemml using the Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip are as follows:

    conda create --name chemml_env python=3.8
    source activate chemml_env
    conda install -c conda-forge openbabel rdkit nb_conda_kernels python-graphviz
    pip install chemml
