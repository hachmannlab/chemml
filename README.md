# ChemML
ChemML is a machine learning and informatics program suite for the analysis, mining, and modeling of chemical and materials data.
Please check the [ChemML website](https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml) for more information.

## Code Design:
ChemML is developed in the Python 3 programming language and makes use of a host of data analysis and ML libraries(accessible through the Anaconda distribution), as well as domain-specific libraries. 
The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

The format of library is similar to the well known libraries like Scikit-learn. ChemML will be soon available 
via graphical user interface provided by [ChemEco](https://github.com/hachmannlab/chemeco).
ChemEco is a general-purpose framework for data mining without coding. It also interfaces with many of the libraries that supply methods for the 
representation, preprocessing, analysis, mining, and modeling of large-scale chemical data sets.


## Latest Version:
   - to find out about the latest version and release history, click [here](https://pypi.org/project/chemml/#history)

## Installation and Dependencies:
You can download ChemML from PyPI via pip.

    pip install chemml --user -U

Here is a list of external libraries that will be installed with chemml:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - tensorflow
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - lxml

Since conda installation is not available for ChemML yet, we recommend installing rdkit and openbabel (please install openbabel 2.x not openbabel 3.x) in a conda virtual environment prior to installing ChemML. For doing so, you need to follow the conda installer:

    conda create --name my_chemml_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemml_env
    conda install -c conda-forge rdkit openbabel
    pip install chemml
